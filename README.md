# Advanced Functional Programming in Scala

This second part of Course is focuses on exploring advanced functional programming concepts in Scala, demonstrating the power and flexibility of functional paradigms for developing robust, scalable, and expressive applications.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Multistage Functions, Closures, Partial Functions, Currying and Higher-Order Functions
- **Multistage Functions**: Understand the concept of building functions that evolve through multiple stages of computation.
- **Closures**: Explore how functions can capture the environment in which they are defined, demonstrating the power of functional state encapsulation.
- **Partial Functions**: Learn how to create functions that are only defined for certain inputs, and how to compose them for more flexible computation.
- **Currying**: Master the transformation of functions with multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument, to enhance composability.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Utilize functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions, providing flexible and reusable code through functional composition and transformations.

### 2. Pattern Matching
- **Beyond Basic Examples**: Move past simple examples to understand the full power of Scala's pattern matching, including nested and deep pattern matching.
- **Custom Extractors**: Create and use custom objects for extracting data, making your code more expressive and concise.

### 3. Type Classes and Implicit Parameters
- **Polymorphism without Inheritance**: Leverage type classes to apply the same code to different types, offering a powerful alternative to traditional inheritance.
- **Implicit Parameters**: Understand and utilize implicit parameters to enable flexible and concise function definitions and type-class instances.

### 4. Parallelism with Futures
- **Futures for Concurrency**: Explore the use of Futures to handle asynchronous computations and parallel data processing in a non-blocking fashion.

### 5. Advanced Types
- **Higher-Kinded Types**: Work with types that abstract over type constructors, providing additional layers of type safety and flexibility.
- **Variance**: Understand covariance and contravariance to better model type hierarchies.
- **Implicit Proofs (e.g., CanBuildFrom)**: Utilize Scalaâ€™s implicit resolution to create more generic and reusable code structures.

### 6. Functional Programming in Practice with Cats Library
- **Cats Library**: Leverage the Cats library to apply pure functional programming concepts, including type classes, functors, monads, and more, for cleaner, more predictable code.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Scala syntax and functional programming concepts.
- Experience with object-oriented programming in Scala is recommended.
